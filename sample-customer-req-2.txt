I want the classic snake game to be enhanced by introducing obstacles on the game board. These obstacles should appear randomly or be positioned strategically, requiring the snake to navigate carefully to reach its food without colliding. Additionally, I want clear visual indicators for these obstacles, adjustable difficulty settings to control obstacle frequency and complexity, scoring bonuses for successfully avoiding or navigating through obstacles, and a responsive interface that provides immediate feedback when the snake hits an obstacle or reaches the food.
