  "snake_game/src/settings.py": "Okay, let me look at this Python code and figure out what it does. The file is called settings.py, which is usually where configuration variables are stored. The comments mention configuration and constants, so this is probably a module that holds all the game's settings for easy adjustment.\n\nFirst, the screen width and height are set to 640 and 480. That's the window size. Then there are color definitions using RGB tuplesâ€”black, white, green, red. These are likely used for the background, snake, food, or other elements. The snake size is 20, which might be the block size or the width/height of each segment. The FPS is 10, controlling the game's speed.\n\nSo the docstring needs to summarize all these constants and their purposes. It should mention that this module centralizes configuration, lists each section (window, colors, snake, frame rate), and explains each constant. Also, note that changing these values adjusts the game's appearance and behavior. Maybe mention that other modules import these for consistency.\n</think>\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis module provides centralized configuration constants and settings for a Snake game application.\n\nIt defines global variables that control the game's visual presentation, gameplay mechanics,\nand performance parameters. These settings are organized into logical groups for easy maintenance\nand adjustment.\n\nConstants:\n- SCREEN_WIDTH (int): Main game window width in pixels (640px)\n- SCREEN_HEIGHT (int): Main game window height in pixels (480px)\n- [Color Constants]: RGB tuples defining color palette:\n  - BLACK: Background/UI elements (0,0,0)\n  - WHITE: Text/contrasting elements (255,255,255)\n  - GREEN: Snake body color (0,255,0)\n  - RED: Food/special elements (255,0,0)\n- SNAKE_SIZE (int): Pixel dimensions (width/height) for snake segment blocks (20px)\n- FPS (int): Game loop refresh rate (10 frames/sec) controlling snake movement speed\n\nUsage:\nImport this module to access consistent configuration across game components:\n- Display rendering (screen dimensions, colors)\n- Game physics (snake dimensions, movement timing)\n- Visual styling (color scheme)\n\nModifying these values will alter game appearance/behavior without needing code changes elsewhere.\n\"\"\"\n```",
  "snake_game/src/game.py": "Okay, let me try to figure out what this Python code does. The file is game.py in the snake_game/src directory. The code imports pygame and some modules from src.settings, src.snake, and src.food. So, it's a Snake game implementation using Pygame.\n\nLooking at the Game class. The __init__ method initializes pygame, sets up the screen with the width and height from settings, sets the window caption, creates a clock, a Snake instance, a Food instance, and initializes the score. So the game initializes all the necessary components when it starts.\n\nThe check_events method handles events. It loops through the events, checking for QUIT events to close the game. For KEYDOWN events, it checks the arrow keys and changes the snake's direction accordingly. So the user controls the snake with arrow keys.\n\nNext is check_collisions. It checks if the snake's head is at the food's position, which means the snake ate the food. Then the snake grows, the food respawns, and the score increases. Then it checks if the snake hits the window boundaries by checking if the head's x or y is outside the screen dimensions. If so, game_over is called. Also, it checks if the head collides with any part of the snake's body (excluding the head itself), which also triggers game over. So collisions with walls or self cause the game to end.\n\nThe game_over method prints the score and exits pygame and the program. The update method moves the snake and checks for collisions each frame. The draw method fills the screen with black, draws the snake and food, then updates the display. The run method is the main game loop, which processes events, updates the game state, redraws everything, and ticks the clock at the specified FPS.\n\nPutting it all together, this class manages the game loop, handles user input, updates the game state (snake movement, collision detection), renders the game elements, and handles game over scenarios. The Snake and Food classes are imported, so their specific implementations (like how they move or are drawn) are in those modules. The game runs continuously until a collision occurs, then it exits with the final score.\n</think>\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nA Pygame-based Snake game implementation managing game loop, controls, collision detection, and rendering.\n\nThe Game class initializes and controls the core gameplay mechanics including snake movement,\nfood consumption, score tracking, and termination conditions.\n\nResponsibilities include:\n- Initializing game components (window, snake, food, clock)\n- Processing user input for snake direction changes\n- Detecting collisions (food consumption, wall/self collisions)\n- Updating game state and rendering graphics\n- Handling game over scenarios\n\nAttributes:\n    screen (pygame.Surface): Main game window surface\n    clock (pygame.time.Clock): Game clock for FPS control\n    snake (Snake): Player-controlled snake object\n    food (Food): Food object for snake consumption\n    score (int): Current player score\n\nMethods:\n    check_events(): Handles keyboard input and window closure\n    check_collisions(): Detects food/wall/self collisions\n    game_over(): Terminates game and displays final score\n    update(): Updates game state (movement + collision checks)\n    draw(): Renders all game elements to screen\n    run(): Main game loop orchestrating events/updates/rendering\n\nGame Rules:\n- Snake grows when eating food\n- Food respawns to random location after consumption\n- Game ends on wall collision or self-collision\n- Score increments by 1 per food eaten\n- Direction changes via arrow keys (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT)\n\nDependencies:\n- pygame: Handles graphics/input/timing\n- src.settings: Game configuration constants\n- src.snake: Snake behavior and rendering\n- src.food: Food placement and rendering\n\"\"\"\n```"
